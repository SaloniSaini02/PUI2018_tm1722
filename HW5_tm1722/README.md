`Statement: I am using the 72-hour late extension for this homework`

Assignment 1: 
Here, I needed to review my classmate's hypotheses on Citibike data, propose a statistical test, and submit a pull request to their original repository. 

A copy of the .md file I pushed to Karan's repo is in this folder and is called HW5_Assignment1_tm1722.md

Here is the screenshot of my pull request:

Assignment 2: 
Here, I needed to explore scientific papers and fill out a table about statistical analyses. The table is at the end of this file along with screenshots from each paper. 


Assignment 3: 
Here, I needed to reproduce the analysis of the Hard to Employ program NY by filling out and modifying a skeleton notebook provided. 

Can be found in HW5_Assignment3_tm177.ipyn file


Assignment 4: 

Here, I needed to use the scipy package with CitiBiki data and perform K-S Two-Sample test and two samples for correlation (Pearson's and Spearman's)

Correlation | 2, Mimicry Score, Assesed personality scale | ordinal, interval | researchers were focused on just correlations and didn't make a predictive model, so no dependent variables| (none) | (none) | (none) |  Do two methods of measuring people's tendency to imitate each other correlate (since they are assumed to rely on the same mechanisms?
