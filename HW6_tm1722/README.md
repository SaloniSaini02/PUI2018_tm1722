# Homework 6 -- Morning Section

_disclaimer: Worked on assignment 1 with Soham Mody! It was fun! 
             Discussed some things from assignment 2 with Soham too._


__Assignment 1__
For this problem, I needed to follow the skeleton notebook from Dr. Bianco and do dataframe manipulations using pandas on PLUTO data.

See the jupyter notebook _HW6_Assignment1_tm1722.ipynb_ for my solution

__Assignment 2__ 


For this problem, I needed to follow the skeleton notebook and perform various SQL queries on Citibike data.

See _HW4_Assignment2_tm1722.ipynb_ for my solution
