# Homework 2

_disclaimer: Did everything by myself, but with a help of wise people on the internet. I will
update the readme with all of the resource I used soon! _

_disclaimer 2: Since I started to work on this kinda late, I had a luxury of asking 
my classmates what order to do this in! Rohun Iyer recommended this order 1-3-2..He 
also reminded me to pick a categorical variable for Assignment 2. Thanks, Rohun!_

do few more distributions based on what she did for the Chi Squared Distribution
