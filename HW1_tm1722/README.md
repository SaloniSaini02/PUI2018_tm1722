# HW 1!


To set up my CUSP|ADRF environment for the Principles of Urban Informatics Class
I did the following: 



1) Access my CUSP|ADRF bash terminal
2) Created a directory on the CUSP|ADRF called PUI2018
3) Accessed the .bashrc file by using nano .bashrc command
4) Scrolled all the way down, added the following at the end: export PUI2018="~/PUI2018". This created the environmental variable
5) Added this line: alias pui2018="$PUI2018". This created something called an alias. Alias takes you to a directory of the environmental variable you refer to in the alias. Here is the screenshot for 4) and 5):

6) Saved the .bashrc file 
7) Read the new version of .bashrc file by typing the following in the terminal: source ~/.bashprofile 
8) Tested if the environmental variable and alias worked. They did :) 

Here is the screenshot for the test:
